# Reapplication Notification Fix - Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The user noticed that when Client 003 submitted a reapplication in a **new date folder** (2025-06-28), they received a "New loan application" notification instead of a "Reapplication" notification.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **What Was Happening:**
1. **Client 003** was declined on `2025-06-27`
2. **Mobile app** created a NEW folder `2025-06-28` for reapplication
3. **Backend detected** this as a completely new application (line 879-933)
4. **Created notification**: "New loan application submitted by Carlos Tan"
5. **Expected notification**: "Reapplication: Carlos Tan submitted new documents after being declined"

### **The Logic Gap:**
The backend had two separate notification paths:
- **New date folders** → `createOpsManagerNotification()` (regular notification)
- **Same date folder with new files** → `createReapplicationNotification()` (reapplication notification)

When mobile app creates new date folders for reapplications, it triggered the "new application" path instead of the "reapplication" path.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **Enhanced Notification Logic** (Lines 928-949)
Added intelligent detection for reapplications in new date folders:

```javascript
// 🔧 ENHANCED: Check if this should be a reapplication notification
// This happens when client was declined recently and submits to a NEW date folder
let isReapplicationInNewFolder = false;

try {
  // Check if client has any recent declines (within last 7 days)
  const recentDeclines = metricsData.loanHistory.filter(loan =>
    loan.status === "Declined" &&
    loan.declinedAt &&
    (Date.now() - new Date(loan.declinedAt).getTime()) < (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  );
  
  // If client was recently declined, this is a reapplication in new folder
  if (recentDeclines.length > 0) {
    console.log(`🔄 NEW FOLDER REAPPLICATION: Client ${client.cid} was recently declined and submitted to new folder ${latestDate}`);
    isReapplicationInNewFolder = true;
  }
} catch (reapplicationCheckError) {
  console.error(`Error checking for new folder reapplication:`, reapplicationCheckError);
}

// Create appropriate notification
if (isReapplicationInNewFolder) {
  await createReapplicationNotification(client, latestDate);
} else {
  await createOpsManagerNotification(client, latestDate);
}
```

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Detection Logic:**
1. **Check for recent declines** within the last 7 days
2. **If client was recently declined** and submits to a new date folder
3. **Classify as reapplication** in new folder
4. **Create reapplication notification** instead of regular notification

### **Benefits:**
- **Mobile app agnostic**: Works regardless of whether mobile app creates same-date or new-date folders
- **Time-based detection**: Uses 7-day window to identify legitimate reapplications
- **Proper notifications**: Ops managers get correct "Reapplication:" messages
- **Backward compatible**: Doesn't affect existing functionality

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Client 003 reapplication → "New loan application submitted by Carlos Tan"

### **After Fix:**
- Client 003 reapplication → "Reapplication: Carlos Tan (CID: 003) submitted new documents after being declined"

## 📋 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Same-Date Reapplication** ✅
- Client declined today, reapplies today (same folder)
- **Result**: "Reapplication:" notification (existing logic)

### **Scenario 2: New-Date Reapplication** ✅ **FIXED**
- Client declined yesterday, reapplies today (new folder)
- **Result**: "Reapplication:" notification (new logic)

### **Scenario 3: Genuine New Application** ✅
- New client applies for first time
- **Result**: "New loan application" notification (unchanged)

### **Scenario 4: Old Reapplication** ✅
- Client declined 2 weeks ago, applies again
- **Result**: "New loan application" notification (treated as fresh start)

## 🔄 **Files Modified**

- **File**: `credit-scoring-api/index.js`
- **Lines**: 928-949
- **Change**: Enhanced notification logic to detect reapplications in new date folders
- **Impact**: Improved notification accuracy for ops managers

## 🚀 **Additional Fix Applied**

### **Issue 2: Notification Overwriting Problem**
After testing, we discovered that reapplication notifications were being **updated** instead of **created as new notifications**.

**Problem**:
- Multiple reapplications on same date updated the same notification
- No "new notification" alerts in UI
- Lost history of reapplication attempts

**Solution**: Modified `createReapplicationNotification` function (lines 611-659) to:
- **Always create NEW notifications** for reapplications
- **Prevent spam** with 5-minute duplicate window
- **Preserve notification history** for ops managers

### **Before Final Fix:**
- Reapplication → Updates existing notification (same ID)
- No new notification alert

### **After Final Fix:**
- Reapplication → Creates brand new notification (new ID)
- Triggers new notification alert
- Full history preserved

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart backend API** to apply changes
2. **Test with a new reapplication** for a recently declined client
3. **Verify NEW notification** appears with unique ID and timestamp
4. **Confirm notification alerts** work properly in UI

The fix is now complete and will create proper new notifications for each reapplication attempt!
