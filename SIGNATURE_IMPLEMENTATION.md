# LoanSiya Signature Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds signature functionality to the LoanSiya web app for the Operations Manager to digitally sign loan agreements after approval.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Screens Created

#### SignatureAgreementScreen.js
- **Location**: `src/screens/ops/SignatureAgreementScreen.js`
- **Purpose**: Captures digital signature from Operations Manager
- **Features**:
  - Loan agreement summary display
  - Web-compatible signature canvas (using `react-signature-canvas`)
  - Mobile fallback (using `react-native-signature-canvas`)
  - Signature validation and preview
  - Clear and capture signature functionality

#### SignedAgreementPreview.js
- **Location**: `src/screens/ops/SignedAgreementPreview.js`
- **Purpose**: Shows PDF preview with embedded signature
- **Features**:
  - Agreement details summary
  - PDF preview with signature embedded
  - Final approval confirmation
  - Automatic loan approval and navigation back to pending list

### 2. Navigation Updates

#### App.js
- Added new screens to navigation stack:
  - `SignatureAgreement` → SignatureAgreementScreen
  - `SignedAgreementPreview` → SignedAgreementPreview

### 3. UI Changes

#### OpsPendingLoanDetailScreen.js
- **Change**: Replaced "Approve" button with "Sign Agreement" button
- **Navigation**: Now navigates to SignatureAgreementScreen instead of directly approving
- **User Display**: Shows actual logged-in username instead of hardcoded "Operations Manager"

### 4. Backend Updates

#### pdfGenerator.js
- **Enhanced**: `generatePromissoryNote()` function now accepts signature and signerName parameters
- **Features**:
  - Embeds base64 signature image into PDF
  - Shows actual signer name instead of hardcoded "Operations Manager"
  - Maintains backward compatibility for unsigned documents

#### API Endpoints (index.js)
- **New Endpoint**: `POST /generate-promissory-note`
  - Generates PDF with signature for preview
  - Returns PDF buffer for browser display

- **Enhanced Endpoint**: `POST /loan/:cid/decision`
  - Now accepts `signature` and `signerName` parameters
  - Stores signed PDF with different filename when signature provided
  - Saves signature metadata for audit trail

### 5. Dependencies Added

#### Frontend
- `react-signature-canvas`: Web-compatible signature capture
- `react-native-signature-canvas`: Mobile signature capture (existing)

#### Backend
- No new dependencies required (uses existing PDFKit)

## Workflow

### Complete User Flow
1. **OpsPendingLoanDetail** → User clicks "Sign Agreement"
2. **SignatureAgreement** → User reviews loan details and provides digital signature
3. **SignedAgreementPreview** → User reviews PDF with embedded signature
4. **Final Approval** → System approves loan and saves signed document
5. **Return to List** → User navigated back to OpsPendingList

### Technical Flow
1. Signature captured as base64 PNG
2. PDF generated with embedded signature image
3. Signed PDF stored in GCS with timestamp
4. Loan status updated to "Approved" with signature metadata
5. Signature metadata stored separately for audit trail

## Key Features

### ✅ Web Compatibility
- Uses `react-signature-canvas` for web browsers
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile web
- Fallback to mobile signature canvas for native apps

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Signature metadata stored (signer name, timestamp, CID, amount)
- Signed PDFs stored with clear naming convention
- Maintains record of who signed what and when

### ✅ User Experience
- Clear multi-step workflow
- Real-time signature validation
- PDF preview before final approval
- Error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Security
- Signature embedded directly in PDF
- Cannot approve without valid signature
- Signature validation before proceeding

## Notes

### Known Limitations
- Signature canvas requires user interaction (cannot be automated)
- PDF generation requires backend API to be running
- Large signatures may impact PDF file size

### Future Enhancements
- Signature encryption for additional security
- Multiple signature support for co-signers
- Signature verification against stored biometrics
- Integration with DocuSign or other e-signature providers

## Environment Requirements

### Development
- Node.js environment
- React Native Web setup
- Express.js backend with PDF generation capabilities
- Google Cloud Storage for document storage

### Dependencies
- `react-signature-canvas` (web)
- `react-native-signature-canvas` (mobile)
- `pdfkit` (backend PDF generation)
- `@google-cloud/storage` (document storage)
